    - Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie
    - Allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).
    - Allow users to see the cast of a selected movie
    - Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (star).
    - Allow users to share the movie trailer link to social media or any other sharing platform on long press
   
## What Will I Learn After Stage 2?
 - Make use of Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle) to create a robust an efficient application.
 - Create a database using Room to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).

## API Key
The movie information uses [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API.
To make your app work, you have to enter your own API key into `build.gradle` file.
